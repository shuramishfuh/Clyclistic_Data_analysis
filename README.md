 Business Task
 
 Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, is focused on expanding its customer base by increasing the number of annual memberships. Currently, the company’s customers fall into two categories:
 	1.	Casual riders who purchase single-ride or full-day passes.
 	2.	Annual members who have committed to year-long memberships.
 
 The company’s director of marketing believes that converting casual riders into annual members will be key to sustainable growth. To support this objective, Cyclistic’s marketing team aims to understand how casual riders and annual members differ in their use of Cyclistic bikes. These insights will guide the development of a targeted marketing strategy focused on converting casual riders into annual members.
 
 Primary Question
 
 The primary question guiding this analysis is:
 	•	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
 
 Understanding this difference will highlight the unique needs, patterns, and behaviors of each user type, offering insights that could help the team tailor their messaging and outreach to casual riders, encouraging them to commit to an annual membership.
 
 Secondary Questions
 
 While the primary question is the main focus of the analysis, two secondary questions can provide additional context for the marketing strategy:
 	1.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? Understanding motivations and barriers will offer insights into potential incentives or messaging that might appeal to casual riders.
 	2.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? Exploring effective digital media strategies can guide marketing tactics, allowing Cyclistic to reach casual riders where they are most active and receptive.
